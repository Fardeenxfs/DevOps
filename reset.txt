to learn git reset
git reset command will moves the all committed files to untracked phase till our desired commit here we are doing handson on it.

handson did:
i have accidentally commited some sensitve info with this reset file
then used git reset <commit_id> command to reset the commits to the presious commits
this reverted back the commit done to the reset file and moved the reset file and sensitive info file to untracked phase, which helped me in securing the sensitive info.
